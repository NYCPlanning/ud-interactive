## Public Drawing Precedents

### NYC Planning Urban Design Online Toolkit

---

**Objective:** Design + prototype a small collection of browser-based public drawings that communicate about urban design + physical planning issues
<br>
**We are thinking about:**
- exploring web dev as a way of drawing
- how to expand the approach of architectural drawing + adapt it to a new medium
- better ways to draw entities responsible for the public realm

### Narrative + Visibility of Characteristics
How do we represent spatial awareness?
What characteristics do we want visible? From an urban design perspective, what are aspects of data driven governance that are of interest to us?

### Accessibility
Thinking proactively about: 
- internationalization
- the differently abled
- language
- graphic conventions
- what feels comfortable/familiar/inviting vs. having a tone of authority

What is intuitive, especially for the general public?

---
### Guided vs. Open Navigation

- NYTimes Immersive Experiences - 'scroll to explore'

- [Manhattan Population Explorer](http://manpopex.us/) - includes both a guided sequence + exploratory aspects

- [Bear 71](https://bear71vr.nfb.ca/) - sequenced narrative with option to jump around, exploratory aspects in each chapter

- [Tomas Bata University](https://jenamdvacet.cz/) - 'tour' option in addition to free exploration

- [Feral Atlas](https://feralatlas.supdigital.org/)

---
### Authorship
How do we treat drawing as more collaborative, especially with web dev?
How do we make these drawings/the website more democratic? Who can contribute? How can we create dialogue/start conversations through the drawing?

- [Bear 71](https://bear71vr.nfb.ca/) - beginning scene includes film credits

- [Refugee Republic](https://refugeerepublic.submarinechannel.com/) - credits tab

### Follow-up Questions

What kinds of drawings are going to be communicated?

Who is the audience of these drawings? Who will be using this platform? How will people come into contact with this platform?

What are you hoping people get of the drawings?

How have past drawings been used for public engagement purposes?

What would be most exciting to see?
