## Public Drawing Precedents

### NYC Planning Urban Design Online Toolkit

---

**Objective:** Design + prototype a small collection of browser-based public drawings that communicate about urban design + physical planning issues
<br>
**We are thinking about:**
- exploring web dev as a way of drawing
- how to expand the approach of architectural drawing + adapt it to a new medium
- better ways to draw entities responsible for the public realm

### Accessibility
Thinking proactively about: 
- internationalization
- the differently abled
- language
- graphic conventions
- what feels comfortable/familiar/inviting vs. having a tone of authority

What is intuitive, especially for the general public?

### Guided vs. Open Navigation

- NYTimes Immersive Experiences - 'scroll to explore'
- [Manhattan Population Explorer](http://manpopex.us/) - includes both a guided sequence + exploratory aspects
- [Bear 71](https://bear71vr.nfb.ca/) - sequenced narrative with option to jump around, exploratory aspects in each chapter
- [Feral Atlas](https://feralatlas.supdigital.org/)

### Authorship
How do we treat drawing as more collaborative, especially with web dev?
