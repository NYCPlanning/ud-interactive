## Illustration Styles Pros/Cons

---

### Static Image: Base drawing with organization of various elements in one drawing (anatomic precedent, instruction manual/product guide precedent)
**Ideally, using: Photoshop to create individual entities, Illustrator to compose drawing**

**Pros**
- Can utilize various methods for callouts/annotations i.e. highlighting, color coding
- Relatively easy to convert to web based drawing if vector drawing/if there are clean layers for each element
- Can use cutouts as raster images and compose/assemble them in the browser alongside a vector drawing (inspo: zine from PDC)
- On web-side could potentially do a zoom-in into a piece of the drawing for heightened, detailed look that could be more engaging

**Cons**
- Less immersive (not 3D space)
- Ideally, every single figure of the drawing is its own layer/separate entity (i.e. in a streetscape composed of individual people - each figure is its own layer)

	**Section perspective**

	**Pros**
	- Able to show above and below ground
	- Can see a web-based version like the refugee republic example (https://refugeerepublic.submarinechannel.com/wandeling_en.php?w=4)
	- Can also see potential ways of increasing interactivity with moving parts (if individual objects are its own layer) - potentially like with the underground subway or sewer system?

	**Cons**

	**Collages**
	
	**Pros**
	- Potentially most readable to the general public?
	- Can use cutouts as raster images and compose/assemble them in the browser alongside a vector drawing (inspo: [zine from PDC](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/designcommission/downloads/pdf/PDC-PARKing-Day-2020-ZINE-pages.pdf))

	**Cons**
	- Depending on how much needs to be represented, could be overwhelming on first glance

	**Axonometric master plan**

	**Pros**
	- If beginning as a rhino file, could potentially be converted into 3d graphics of buildings via grasshopper and made immersive / walkable / explorable
	- Can utilize various methods for callouts/annotations i.e. highlighting, color coding

	**Cons**
	- Potentially most intensive drawing to turn interactive on web-end (but end result if successful would look really cool)

### Animation/gif/3D scene: Most likely a drawing created using Mental Canvas

**Pros**
- Precedent of web-based drawing created using mental canvas, should be do-able
- Nature of animation lends itself to be an immersive scene quite easily

**Cons**
- Some of the annotative bits might have to happen within the drawing? though it shouldnâ€™t be too hard to find a workaround
- Carsten would need to take the time to learn how exporting works on mental canvas
- More of an ambitious endeavor given current timeline and when we need a draft of the drawing by
