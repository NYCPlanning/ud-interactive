### Notes from Julien

**How does the urban design office interact with the public? What is the role of these drawings?**
- Haven't done many interactive drawings
- Usually when we interact with the public, it's public events in the streets with drawings that we created and printed on paper
- We've tried to explore ways to create interactive drawings
	- Metro north study - simple drawings made, started to be interactive
- Developing the first interactive drawing online together right now
- [David's interactive drawing](http://davidvegabarachowitz.com/dcp/interactive/) was to have public understand urban design principles
- Currently working on ehq website - engagement hq - develops websites for public organizations to create engagement tools online, contracted agency - using platform to create a survey and set of questions to ask general public about urban design and how they perceive the public realm around them
	- big piece of the interactive tool is an animation - not interactive yet - being made with mental canvas - something we can look at together - but limited bandwidth at the office
	- would be great if animation could also be interactive to give general public the opportunity to move through the drawing itself

**What is the process of creating a drawing?**
- Draw a lot on the Surface using Photoshop, but, before, used a lot of tracing paper as layers and used them on photoshop to draw the people, the buildings, the new constructions and scanning everything and cleaning everything on photoshop and stitching everything together on photoshop
	- creates multi layer drawings that are super easy to edit, didn’t have to erase a big chunk of the drawing to edit because of the layers
- Since using the Surface, don’t have to draw on tracing paper anymore, don’t have to stitch the drawings to ensure that they align on top of each other
- Connected communities guidebook - everything made using computer software
	- Starting with stitching together different parts of the city to create a prototypical model of the city which can be anywhere in nyc but is not nyc
	- Used rhino, GIS first to bring in, creating axons on Rhino and exporting it to photoshop and started drawing on top of the Rhino outlines to give more of a handdrawn touch to the drawing
- When doing drawings on photoshop, super well organized, using layers to their full extent, easy to tweak drawings when creating

**How much collaboration is there in the drawing process? How do you iterate through drawings? What is the review process?**
- When it comes to drawing, the style of one person is very recognizable - trying to have the same person drawing most of the drawings for one study
- Collaboration done with Chau, had to draw perspective views with the soho/noho study to communicate how the new buildings would interact with existing conditions
	- Julien did the rough draft drawing using an existing photo and drawing on top of the photo
	- because the Manhattan office shared where the new construction would be, knew where to draw the new buildings but for this one didn’t use any Rhino model or sketchup model, was just Julien and Chau approximating how big the buildings would be
	- Julien drew the characters, all the streetlife, and Chau worked on the existing conditions and colored the drawings themselves
- When working together, if one person draws the characters, the same person draws all of them and same for any other element of the image
- For the coloring, we use a lot of palettes created out of pencils at the office to give a nice touch to the drawings
- Mix of both artisanal methods with computer based methods - works together pretty well because computer-based methods allow them to be quicker, more flexibility, and easier edits. Artisanal methods allow for a more human touch.

**What are challenges in the drawing process?**
- Challenge, for example in the animation being created, is being the only person working on a drawing.
	- only person in the office who knows how to use Mental Canvas
	- need big surface to use mental canvas correctly
	- would be better to have someone work with him on it

**What is the role of text in these drawings? Does it come before or after?**
- Add-on after most of the time
- Most of the drawings done, quite often, not responsible for the annotations
	- it's normally the colleagues who are planners at the borough offices that annotate the drawings
- Ex: [Jerome Ave](https://nyco365.sharepoint.com/sites/NYCPLANNING/ud/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=IvClyN&cid=a85337bb%2D2e72%2D4090%2Da0d3%2D26558dabe450&RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FNYCPLANNING%2Fud%2FShared%20Documents%2F%5FBX%2Fjerome%20avenue&FolderCTID=0x012000A467B5FFDA98464D8650624D6E0A930B)

**Misc comments**
- Thinks Jerome Ave could've been a great interactive drawing
	- lives online
	- large brochure, 4 pages with internal drawings within it
	- can imagine an interactive version of it where you can click ont he drawings and see information pop up
	- could've been interesting to think about it as an interactive tool because there's a lot of projects being built and investments being made in the neighborhood now after the project on the DCP side has been done
		- could've been nice to track these changes and maybe use the brochure as a reference for people to interact with it
	- **something we are not very good at DCP** - once a study is done, we have issues with going back to how we could better communicate the positive changes in the neighborhood - missed opportunity
